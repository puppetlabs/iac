    <p>Greetings from the IAC Team - before we start we would just like to say that we echo <a href="https://twitter.com/puppetize/status/1267558026858266625">Puppet’s recent statement</a>, that we stand with the black community now and always.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Puppet stands with the Black community. We stand against racism, violence and hate. Equality is not a privilege. Justice is not a privilege. These are rights for everyone. Silence prevents progress so join us in speaking up for equality and justice for Black lives now and always.</p>

<h2 id="temporary-interuption-to-test-infrastructure">Temporary Interuption to Test Infrastructure</h2>
<p>Due to the AddTrust intermediate certificate expiring, all Github Actions tests that we are running to verify modules on commercially licensed and/or non-dockerizable OS, we were not running any releases this week. A support ticket with VMware has been raised as apparently changing certificate chains is not as straight-forward as one might expect. Big Thanks to the DIO team who is working tirelessly on this issue.</p>

<h2 id="module-releases-from-iac-team">Module Releases from IAC Team</h2>
<p>The release process for the following modules has been started and although we have had some issues, as was elaborated on above, we hope to get them out soon.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-postgresql">puppetlabs/postgresql</a> (6.6.0)</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-ibm_installation_manager">puppetlabs/ibm_installation_manager</a> (2.2.0)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="community-contributions">Community Contributions</h2>
<p>The wonderful community members that continue to contribute to our modules have provided us with the following enhancements:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-java_ks/pull/319"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">puppetlabs-java_ks#319</code></a>:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/tomkitchen">tomkitchen</a> a first time contributor has worked hard to add the ability to import a DER formatted certificate file and its corresponding key into a keystore.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-docker/pull/620"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">puppetlabs-docker#620</code></a>:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/runejuhl">runejuhl</a> a returning contributor has updated the code so as to allow all 3.x docker-compose minor versions, expanding the range with which we are compatible.</li>
</ul>

<p>Many thanks to <a href="https://github.com/tomkitchen">tomkitchen</a> and <a href="https://github.com/junejuhl">runejuhl</a> for the work that they have put in and we hope to see more in the future.</p>

<h2 id="ubuntu-2004-certification">Ubuntu 20.04 Certification</h2>
<p>Over the last week or two <a href="https://github.com/david22swan">I</a> have personally worked on adding support to all of our relevant modules with much of it having been completed. As of right now there are only a small handful of modules that require some further work in order for us to officially declare that they support the new OS. Follow along at <a href="https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-746">IAC-746</a>.</p>

<h2 id="new-litmus-github-io-page">New Litmus Github IO Page</h2>
<p>A new docs microsite containing all that we know about the excellent Litmus tool has been released just this week. This <a href="https://puppetlabs.github.io/litmus">site</a>, created with care by the combined brilliance of our very own <a href="https://github.com/DavidS">David Schmitt</a> and the docs teams star <a href="https://github.com/clairecadman">Claire Cadman</a> will take you through everything you need to know about Litmus and help you get of the ground running with a mix of technical documentation and step-by-step walkthroughs.</p>

<p>The site is (like this blog) powered by Jekyll, and its code available for review and contribution at <a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/litmus">puppetlabs/litmus</a>.</p>

<h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap-up</h2>
<p>Well, that’s all folks!
If you’re eager for more then be sure to tune in next week for more from the exciting adventures of the IAC team!</p>
