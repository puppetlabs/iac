This week I started to prepare for my final year of uni and reflect back on what I have learnt during my placement year with Puppet.

I completed several courses on web-development using Linked In Learning. Check out the links below:-
- [HTML Essential Training](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/html-essential-training-4?u=2098212)
- [HTML Images and Figures](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/html-images-and-figures/welcome?u=2098212)

I also found some useful resources and saved them for my final year projects.
- [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/)
- [Cascading Style Sheets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
- [Using CSS Counters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Lists_and_Counters/Using_CSS_counters)
- [CSS Essential Training](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/css-essential-training-3?u=2098212)

I also went to the office for the first time as an intern on Thursday 29th August 2021 ever since joining Puppet for my internship in September 2020.
It was great to see everyone in person!

I was also given some useful tips by my manager on how to become a better developer when we went out for a coffee.

Some of the tips included:-
- During my free time in the holidays, consider developing web apps. This will help me learn the commands of the languages I plan to use during the development phase as well as improve my coding skills.
- Before doing any coding, consider writing the functionality of the program/algorithm in puesdocode.
- Think about how the application could be tested? What test scripts could be written etc?

Thanks for these useful tips Norman and I will take them in consideration when developing apps :)

That's everything for this week!
