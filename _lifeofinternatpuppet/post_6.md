Hi everyone!

This week I have nothing much to say!
As always the week started off with a 1:1 session with Norman.
I continued to work on my Learning VM [Quest Guide](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-quest-guide) after completing the VIM tutorial last week.

I also started to look into doing some recap sessions on the traning received so far. Some of the topics I was looking at were Litmus and Running Tests.

I did another session on the tag and release process with [Daiana](https://github.com/daianamezdrea)

I have been approached by Caoimhe for helping out on the Queen's University Graduate Recruitment and Placement Fair this year, starting from 22nd October 2020.
I am really looking forward to the event.
Thank you Norman for recommending my name.

At this week's show and tell session on Wednesday, David Swan delivered a presentation on puppet-lint and rubcop.

I also worked with Adrian and Paula on doing some debugging of errors on the Learning VM Training.
Thank you for all your help Adrian and Paula.

Have a good weekend everyone!

See you next week!
