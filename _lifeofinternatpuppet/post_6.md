Hi everyone!

This week I have nothing much to say! As always the week started off with a 1:1 session with Norman. I continued to work on my Learning VM Quest Guide after completing the VIM tutorial last week.

I also started to look into doing some recap sessions on the traning received so far. Some of the topics I was looking at were Litmus and Running Tests.

I did another session on the tag and release process with Daiana

I have been approached by Caoimhe for helping out on the Queen's University Graduate Recruitment and Placement Fair this year, starting from 22nd October 2020. I am really looking forward to the event. Thank you Norman for recommending my name.

At this week's show and tell session on Wednesday, David Swan delivered a presentation on puppet-lint and rubocop.

I also worked with Adrian and Paula on doing some debugging of errors on the Learning VM Training. Thank you for all your help Adrian and Paula.

Have a good weekend everyone!

See you next week!
