Not a lot to say this week!

- I continued to work on my linked in learning tutorials which I had saved in order to prep for my final year. Check out my [linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/disha-kareer/) to see what courses I have been working on.

- I informed my manager when I will be returning equipment.

- I finished writing up my last few blog updates for Weeks 45-47.

- I read an article on [contributing to supported modules](https://puppetlabs.github.io/iac/docs/contributing_to_a_module.html) to learn how to write unit and acceptance tests. I also read the following articles on the rspec-puppet:-
    - [tutorial](https://rspec-puppet.com/tutorial/)
    - [documentation](https://rspec-puppet.com/documentation/)

That's everything for this week!

Have a nice weekend everyone!
