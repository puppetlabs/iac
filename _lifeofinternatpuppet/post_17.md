Hi everyone, happy new year 2021! I hope you all had a safe and relaxing Christmas break.

I don't have a lot to say for this week, but some of the key highlights included:-

- [puppetlabs-tagmail](https://forge.puppet.com/modules/puppetlabs/tagmail) (v3.5.0)
- I also completed my first backlog [ticket](https://github.com/puppetlabs/iac/pull/165) on putting the blog posts hyperlinks in an ascending order on the homepage of Life of an Intern Blog.
- I created a ticket and did a release prep for the [puppetlabs-mysql](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-mysql)

I will be working on Community Reporting PRs from next week once I have understood the problem definition in detail.

Thank you to Paula for giving me so many useful pointers during our 1:1 sessions this week!

That's all for this week!

Have a lovely weekend everyone!
