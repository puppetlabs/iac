Hi, everyone

How are you all doing this week?

Well, these two weeks has been the busiest so far in my placement journey with Puppet in their Belfast office.

I am sure you must be wondering what has kept me so busy?

So without wasting time, let's dig into the work I had done this week and also last week, shall we?

The week 7 started off with one to one with Norman on seeing how I got in the previous week 6 work. We have now started to use Lattice to set up agenda, action points for our 1:1s for every Monday :)

Check out lattice [here](https://lattice.com/)
A very good people management platform for companies 1:1 meetings.

I was told by Norman in the 1:1 sync up session that I will have to give a litmus demo next week.
I was also told that I will be given some pull requests (PR's) to work on once a 1:1 meeting is done with my mentor Daiana.
He also told me that when I am debugging code I should use a script command as it will record what commands I have been typing during a session of the terminal.

Now you must be wondering what a script command is in Unix/Linux commands...
Use this [link](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix_commands/script.htm) to find out more!

I was also told to start organising my 1:1 meetings with mentors and other team members to continue training as well as ask questions to mentors about anything.
During the 1:1 meeting with Norman on Monday 12th October 2020, I shared my September's monthly log and got that approved from him by using the Doc Sign App which was set up during the 1:1 session with him.
A quick session with Ciaran was done to get the pry set up done when practicing how to provision a machine and running tests for the litmus demo taking place next Momnday 19th October 2020.

During the practice I noticed that some machines were failing to provision due to the incorrect token specified in the .fog file - this was why the token was failing to provision a machine with the abs. This issue was resolved with the help from Sheena and Ciaran, so many thanks to both of them for giving me their precious time.

On Tuesday 13th October, after finishing the session with Sheena and Ciaran, I worked with Daiana on getting some tips on how to prepare for my Litmus demo which was coming up in the following week. Now I am sure you must be wondering what is Litmus? What does it do etc etc?

Why not check this [link out](https://puppet.com/blog/litmus-new-module-acceptance-testing-tool/) to find out more information about Litmus.

The second part of the session with Daiana was on testing a pull request (pr) from the community, my first ticket was assigned to me (changing author name of supported modules to puppetlabs). A to-do-list was given by Daiana on what I learnt in part 2 of the meeting. She also suggested to keep a word document on all the necessary commands used on a day-to-day basis when doing work, She felt having that document really reduces the stress to search for commands within the MAC OS terminal when working on a ticket/issue.

I still have to put together a document which will include all the necessary... stay tuned for it!

On the same day I did a sync up session with Ciaran where we set up an agenda for the demo, the pry testing environment was done, a link to the litmus testing tool was given to help with the steps of how to do the provisioning of a machine with litmus and to run acceptance tests on the provisioned machine. He also suggested to create a video on litmus demo and share it on the YouTube Demos page, but this didn't happened during the litmus demo because when I asked Norman, he was like the demo on Litmus is quite informal, you don't really need to prepare anything very formal such as a presentation or a video. It is all about testing your understanding on Litmus, what it is, how does it work and how you can run acceptamce tests using this tool for a provisioned machine.

A link to the Puppet's PowerPoint Presentation was also sent by Daniel and David Swan but it wasn't used for creating a presentation on Litmus demo as the demo itself was quite informal, as said by Norman previously.

Now you must be thinking how did I found the litmus demo myself, well the answer is that I was fully prepared for it, did lots and lots of practice, I was asked lots of questions by Norman during the demo session and I learnt some new commands during the session like script command, history command etc...

There be more information hopefully shared by Norman on the script command in the coming weeks, so keep your eye out for useful links etc...

On Wednesday 14th October 2020, I continued to work on the to do list given by Daina on Tuesday within the slack channel, I really enjoyed doing as it helped me debug errors by myself so thank you to Daiana for always helping me out when needed!

Later on that morning, I also attended the EMEA Food/Chat Session where the following topics were covered by the team :-

- Git bisect and conquer
- Luchi - How to SSH into Windows?

After the EMEA Food and Chat Session, I attended a session with Daiana where I was told to do a review/merge once the rubucop bug failure was fixed. This was done successfully.
I attended the Show and Tell Session from 2pm to 3:30pm.

I also informed Norman about my GP appointment on Friday and shared my plans for the QUB Graduate Recruitment and Placement Fair which will take place on Thursday 22nd October 2020 from 2pm-6pm.
I am really looking forward to the event!

I emailed QUB Careers for a 1:1 appointment for next week, regarding my September monthly log approved by Norman earlier in the week.

On Thursday 15th October 2020 I started off my morning by setting up some 1:1 meetings on Lattice and scheduled training sessions with Michael on Windows Powershell and DSC Builder for next week.

After doing that, I attended a short demo on releasing the puppetlabs-firewall module, where Daiana showed me the process once again. Daiana did the release stage of the process while she gave me the responsibility of doing the tag process for that module and raise a pr for review before mergeback took place in the final stage.

Once this was done, Daiana and I attended a session delivered by David Swan on Networking Modules. I really enjoyed that knowledge sharing session and plan to get some hands-on experience when I am free as I would love to explore what it will include, just out of curiosity!

I shared the training and show and tell session recordings on the shared Google Drive Space with the IAC Team.

During the second part of releasing a module with Daiana, I become familiar with some new git commands like 'git branch -a', 'git diff' and 'git log' to name a few!

I attended the stand-up session at 2pm that day as normal. This was where Norman strongly suggested that I should step back from the training and get real work done by looking at the Community PR's. Next month, I could be possible that I will be giving another demo to Norman on the Community Management Tool, so look out for the details in the upcoming blog updates!!

Once the standup was done, I did a sync up with Paula and Daiana on the Litmus demo, this was a very useful session prior to Monday 19th October 2020, as I was given the oppotunity to show my mentors what I know and don't know, Paula and Daina were a great help as always, so thank you very much, it made me quite confident for the upcoming demo on Monday.

I also attended the Big Picture Session and contacted Beth Glenfield about Events on the EEECS Student Sustainability Team Projects, the purpose of contacting her was to see if she would be interested to do a session on Gender and Equality, she volunteered to do it.

Finally its Friday!

Yayyyyyy!!!!!!

The morning started off by sharing some more recordings from the demos on the shared Google Drive space for the IAC Team.

I couldn't write the blog update that week as I wasn't well that day, so sorry for the delay, but I catched up on my pending blog updates now :)

I attended the Friday Wrap Up as usual, had a 1:1 with Caoimhe as I had some questions, don't remember exactly what they were, sorry again :)

I was invited to a zoom call by Ciaran and David Schmitt, where they were trying to debug issues on Crontab and its configuration set up.

The error/issue with a solution in Ciaran's own words :-

"Error/Issue: cron is not executing the configured scripts as expected. Permission errors on crontab file being reported to syslog. Additional issue of “can’t fork” errors manifesting this morning
solution suggested was wrap the command in bash -c to ensure it’s correctly invoked, but the problem still persisted"

During that demo session with Ciaran and David Schmitt, I also asked Ciaran if he had a sync up with Paula or Daiana from yesterday's 1:1 to see if he knows what I did with Paula and Diana/what are the plans for the upcoming week. Ciaran said 'due to other commitments he hasn't had a chance I think, don't remember exactly what he said during the session.

Thats all for now for the week 7 update, happy reading :)


Welcome to Week 8...

Time is flying at placement when busy, isn't?

This week a lot is going on within the team, so lets get started...

On Monday 19th October 2020, before having my litmus demo with Norman, I had a quick sync up with Ciaran before the demo at 10:30am.
During the session with Ciaran he asked me to check if the provisioning of a machine as working fine, because on Saturday when I was doing my practice for the litmus demo, I noticed that the provisioning was failing once again, so that's why the sync up was important with Ciaran prior to the demo.
We run the process again and it worked fine.

The 1:1 with Norman started off with the demo and session over-ran because there was lots to talk about in relation to tickets being assigned and other important questions...

So I will say firstly that the demo was amazing, I really enjoyed the experience and got more knowledge from someone like Norman who had 20 years experience in mentoring... Sorry Norman, I had to reveal this fact as I think anyone reading this post should be aware of this fact :)

He also said that next time when I am using Litmus and running tests on a provisioned machine, I should select a difficult module/repository to clone down from GitHub, just to give muself a challenge and see if I am do the same process sucessfully!
I will look into this later in the coming weeks so stay connected to find out more :)

He also suggested that I should read up on the fundamentals of unix and bash commands via [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/) as it will really help me in my day-to-day work.

He also gave me a breakdown on how I should start my first ticket/task on changing the author name of the supported modules to 'puppetlabs' He gave me useful advice was given on how I should approach the ticket, so thank you so much Norman for all your help to get me started off on my first ticket!ß

He also told me to stop using Lattice for meetings with mentors, and he suggested that I should create a document and share it with him and my three mentors, Ciaran, Daiana and Paula respectively so that they know what I am going to ask them in the next 1:1 mentoring session.
Thank you for the suggestion Norman.

After the session with Norman was finished, I started to work on my first ticket!

I read the ticket carefully, especially the tasks I was given to do by Paula.
I spent the rest of the day going over the meta.json file to see which modules' author name needs to be changed to 'puppetlabs'

I created a list of the modules which needed their author name changed and edited the files inside VIM Text Editor before submitting a PR for review and merging the new changes respectively.

I had to repeat the process from scratch with Paula on Tuesday morning as I did it in the wrong way, so it needed to be fixed. A demo was done was Paula and I tried again all day but got lost in the process so on Wednesday I requested Ciaran to do a step-by-step demo once again so that I can understand where I was going wrong.
After the demo with Ciaran I was able to do the rest of the five modules successfully and the ticket was finished before the standup session on Wednesday.

Also on Wednesday, Norman requested me to share the Google document with him and the mentors for the 1:1 meetings, and as promised I uploaded a copy to the IAC Team shared space. Norman shared with me sone [LinkedInLearning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/) videos on [Git](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/git-essential-training-the-basics?u=2098212) and [GitHub](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-git-and-github?u=2098212) I will be looking at them when I have some free time.

Once the standup session was done, I attended the fortnight session with David Schmitt - 'informal chat about career, tech and general advice' and told him how I am getting on and also asked some of the questions I had planned before the session.

The questions I asked included:-

- Recap on Honeycomb
- IAC Guidelines Document - what does the IAC Team Role includes? Do I need a session on this as I have a fair idea of what the IAC Team does on a day-to-day basis?

David Schmitt sent me some reading material links on [Honeycomb](https://docs.honeycomb.io/) and said that he will follow up with Norman on what he means by IAC Team Role (within the IAC Guidelines Document)

I also asked him if it would be a good idea to contact Daniel again regarding some of his training sessions listed in the document. He said that it would be a good idea and ask him if he can do a training session with you some time next week, as he should have some free time.
Based on the advice given by David Schmitt, I contacted Daniel and we got a session scheduled for Friday 30th October in the morning from 11am - 12pm for a training session on Docker and Kubernetes. Thank you Daniel for giving me your time next Friday. Looking forward to the session!

A sync up session prior to the QUB Graduate Recruitment and Placement Fair was also done on Monday 5pm with Caoimhe and the rest of the team who volunteered to help at the virtual fair this year on Thursday 22nd October 2020. I am really excited and looking forward to the fair on Thursday :)

On Wednesday after the sync up with Ciaran, regarding the diffculty to understand the process told my Paula on Tuesday 20th October 2020, I had a 1:1 session with Caoimhe, some of the topics we covered were - navigating confluence, spread the word for more guest speakers for the EEECS Student Sustainability Team running a range of different event series. The show and tell session this week was really interesting as we had a talk around what could be a possible naming conventions standard for github branches should the team follow from now on?
Paula is working on this topic and we will be going back to this discussion in two to three weeks time to make a final decision on this topic.
Stay tuned to know more :)

Caoimhe told me to contact Laura Raney so that she can add me to the Puppet Insider Group and send her content that I would like to added in this month's newsletter.
As told, I contacted Laura via a direct message on Slack and sent her some of the information that I would like to be added in this month's Puppet Insider.
Keep an eye out for the upcoming events, and if interested please contact us today.

Check out the Facebook and LinkedIn pages for more information by searching for 'EEECS Student Sustainability Team' and join the team today for some of the exciting events coming in the next month :)

In the afternoon I had a session with Michael where he give me an interesting session on Windows Powershell and DSC builder via a zoom call. Check out the reading materials on Powershell [here](https://leanpub.com/c/pwshop/c/puppet-some-guid)
Thank you Michael.

I attended the fair with Puppet Team from 2pm-6pm and it was lovely to chat to current students and share my experiences of being an intern at Puppet this year.
An enjoyable afternoon and evening for sure :)
Many thanks to Norman and Caoimhe for inviting me to the fair :)

Just want to wish these people best of luck with their applications for placement year/graduates roles at Puppet!

This morning will be as usual with the Friday Wrap Up session. I gave an update on the work done within the IAC Team this week and thanks for the appreciation Norman as always :)
David Schmitt sent out useful information such as the [team blog](https://puppetlabs.github.io/iac/team/status/2020/10/23/status-update.html) to help me give a summary to the rest of the teams at the Belfast Office as well as gave a mention on Sheena's demo and will attend the social hour (let's hope it's a games afternoon as decided last week)
I'm looking forward to the social hour :)

That's all the updates done from last week and this week :)

Have a good weekend everyone!
