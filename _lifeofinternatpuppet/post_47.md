## Last Working Week with Puppet

It's hard to believe that the year long internship is coming to its end :(

I would like to say a big thank you to the IAC team, HR and IT Team for all their support over the past year. I have made some great memories, learnt lots of new stuff and meet some lovely people during my time at Puppet.

Take care everyone!
