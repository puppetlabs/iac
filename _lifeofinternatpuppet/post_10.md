Hi all,

This week I haven't got a lot to say.... I got my first PTO in Puppet at the start of the week from Monday to Wednesday.
I returned to work on Thursday morning and started doing litmus acceptance testing on the tomcat module which was the first ticket assigned to me before going on PTO. I am delighted to have it completed!
I would also like to say thanks to my mentor Ciaran for a 1:1 session on how to do effective debugging of errors. Thanks Ciaran for such a useful session.

That's all for this week.

Have a good weekend everyone!
