The IAC team has been working on a couple of interesting things in the past week.
Here's a brief overview of what we've been up to:

## Module Releases

- [puppetlabs/accounts](https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/accounts) (v6.1.1)

Modules released by other teams around the company:

## Team Roster Changes

Michael Lombardi, our resident Windows and PowerShell expert, has [announced great news](https://twitter.com/TrebuchetOps/status/1256985345830400002) and will not be available for the next while.

A big HORRAY!! and all the best from the team!

## Virtual Puppet Camp Germany

Puppet Camp Berlin has come and gone.
[Paula](https://github.com/pmcmaw) and [Helen](https://github.com/HelenCampbell) did a fantastic job at MC'ing the event.
Expect the talks to show up on [the YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/PuppetLabsInc/) in a few days.
Until then you can pass your time with one of the talks from the Australian or US East camps.
For example, [Automated Testing of your Infracode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqBzBVTlwWI) by Jesse Reynolds.

Thanks to everyone who contributed, chatted in [Slack](https://slack.puppet.com/), or just was listening in on the talks and learned something!

## Continued Work on Puppet DSC

The [Puppet DSC project](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-41) continues on through phase II, with this week seeing [an annoying bug(https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-781)] being squashed and the first trial modules being sent out to beta testers.

To any community members who still would like to be part of our beta testing program, I encourage you to reach out to [dsc@puppet.com](mailto:dsc@puppet.com) with answers to the following questions:

- What are the top three PowerShell modules with DSC resources you use/depend on the most?

## Community Contributions

When we talk of community it's not just the issues that they have raised, but also the contributions that they have made, so here's a few of the excellent PRs opened by community members that have been merged in over the last week:

> TODO

We would like to thank ... for the contributions and hope to see more from them in the future.

## Short week

With Friday being a bank holiday in the UK and May 1st being a bank holiday in Romania *and* Puppet taking a global mental health day on May 4th, this week was particularly short and compressed. We'll be back to our regular schedule next week.

## PDK

> The [PDK](https://github.com/puppetlabs/pdk) has shifted under the ownership of the IA Content Team.
> The team is currently working on our first PDK release, which we hope to have with you soon.

The release handover was impacted by a garden variety of fun issues from build infrastructure hiccups to a last minute breakage through an upstream gem.
Worry not, the release is still inevitable.

## Wrap-up

That's it for this weeks update, a big THANK YOU for all your contributions and support.
