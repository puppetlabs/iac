# PCT 0.1.0 Pre Release

The DevX team are pleased to announce the availability of our new prototype for Puppet Content Templates (PCT)!

Version `0.1.0` is a pre-release and still very much experimental, however, we'd love to hear feedback on how the new experience is in creating Puppet content.

The aim of this project is to make the process of creating Puppet content as frictionless as possible.
We envisage people being able to intuiatively build up their content towards the end result, piece by piece, keeping the project as lean as possible. If you don't need it, don't add it!

A picture (or GIF) speaks a thousand words.
Check out the [README](https://github.com/puppetlabs/pdkgo/blob/main/README.md) in [`pdkgo`](https://github.com/puppetlabs/pdkgo) to learn [how to install](https://github.com/puppetlabs/pdkgo/blob/main/README.md#installing) the experimental release.
There's also a handy [quick start guide](https://github.com/puppetlabs/pdkgo/blob/main/README.md#quick-start-guide) to help you get familiar with using the tool.

We'd love to hear your feedback on the new experience and you can do this via [Github Discussion](https://github.com/puppetlabs/pdkgo/discussions) in the [`pdkgo`](https://github.com/puppetlabs/pdkgo) repo.
Feel free to ask questions here too - the DevX Team's remit is to make the Developer Experience as great as possible, so we're keen to hear from you!
