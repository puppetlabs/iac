## Happy New TP!

TP Honey has returned to the IAC team. [TP][TP] has been with Puppet for quite a while and has worked on multiple teams. This week we see him return to the IAC team to lend some expertise. [TP][TP] specialises in all things modules and has been a leader in the development of [litmus][litmus]. We are so delighted to have him onboard with us and you will see him around a lot more. You may recognise [TP][TP] as he has done some pretty cool Puppetize talks. Check out one of my favourites called [Litmus and PDK][litmus_and_pdk].

## Happy New Network (Modules)

2021 is going to see the IAC Team invest in more work with our networking modules. This will begin with the Cisco IOS module with the aim to increase the amount of device support and also improve the testing with a potentially very interesting project - stay tuned!

## Our first triage Monday of 2021

Half of the team were on PTO, however the remainder of the team powered through and as a result processed a total of 15 PRs between them on both our tooling and module repos. Such a positive start to the year.

## Migration of our modules to GCP

The majority of our modules have now been migrated to GCP. To check the status of our modules you can see them on our [community management page][community_management]. Any module that does not have a status is yet to be migrated although it is worthwhile noting, the outstanding modules are our most complex modules.

Currently our module status report is showing 96% passing, all of the 4% of failures are being tracked or worked on so we are constantly working on improving this.
